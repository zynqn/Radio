                                            Mr Teo Hin Sieng, 70, has been living alone in his 2-room flat in Toa Payoh for more than 10 years. The retired factory worker has gotten used to the feeling of loneliness over the years, and relies on his faithful guitar to keep him company.

                                            “I like the guitar, you can say that it’s my best friend,” he said with a smile.
                                                <br></br>
                                            Sitting on the sofa, he strummed his guitar and serenaded individuals painting his door with his favorite songs.

Organized by Habitat for Humanity, the inaugural event saw participants cleaning and re-painting the homes of 120 beneficiaries in Chai Chee, Toa Payoh and Redhill in an effort to improve their living conditions.

                                            “We are the only country in the world without a shelter problem,” said Ms Usha Menon, 53, a member of Habitat for Humanity’s board of directors. “But when you go into the 1-room, 2-room apartments today, you will know the kind of problem we face in Singapore, where we have elderly who are living all by themselves.”

                                            One such elderly is 66-year-old Mr Mr Low Chin Hee. He has been living alone for 17 years in a shoebox apartment in Chai Chee. The retiree recounted taking over his family business at the age of 13, and attributed overworking in his youth to his health’s decline. At 40, he had a stroke and was forced to retire.

                                            Despite the tough circumstances, Mr Low remained jovial as he joked with the participants.

                                            “I used to be very handsome, had the ‘curry-pok’ haircut and [wore] flared pants. Other people couldn’t pull it off but I could,” he shared with a laugh.

These participants come over and while helping me, we have small conversations and I tell them stories about how this area has changed over the years,” she said, grateful for the companionship.

He had never witnessed such conditions before and was shocked by what he saw. He felt that the experience was really meaningful as it opened his eyes to the plight of these vulnerable elderly.

                                            29-year-old participant from Allegis, Ms Riqha Moorthy agreed. She was participating in the event as part of her company’s Corporate Social Responsibility. She found the experience rewarding as it has given her a chance to see a side of Singapore that she has never seen before. She said: “We don’t usually hear about these elderly people because we are comfortably living in our five room flats and stuff. The Pioneer generation built the country but they are the most neglected, so I feel the need to help.”

He said: “When we start bringing him to such activities from young, he will feel comfortable volunteering when he’s older.”

                                            These e-Sports commentators share the joy and struggle of their work.

                                            It’s midnight, and Sean ‘Hades’ Goh is all set to work for the next 7 hours.
                                            <br></br>    
                                            The e-Sports shoutcaster is alone in his room, but he always has a global audience in the thousands.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Like a sports commentator, Sean provides running commentary for multi-player video game competitions. His job is to help the audience understand the mechanism of the games, appreciate the players’ strategies and keep them entertained and engaged.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “What gets you the furthest in this industry is how much you love the game,” said Sean, who has worked on tournaments such as the most recent Mars Dota 2 League Macau Qualifiers as well as the Galaxy Battles CIS Qualifiers.
                                            <br></br>
                                            The recent university graduate is a rare full-timer in his field. In Singapore, there are fewer than 10 recognized shoutcasters, and many are working on a freelance basis.
                                            </p>
                                            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mt-4">

                                            The shoutcasting profession came about in recent years thanks to the fast growing electronic sports (e-Sports) market, which is expected to generate some US$700m in revenue this year according to the 2017 Global e-Sports Market Report by Newzoo.
                                            <br></br>
                                            The booming market has made it possible for not just e-Sports players such as Daryl ‘iceiceice’ Koh and Wong ‘NutZ’ Jeng Yih to make a viable career out of their passion. Gaming enthusiasts who are blessed with a good voice are also able to find work opportunities in shoutcasting.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “Games are complicated,” said Lim “LysanderXonora” Lyn-Feng, a freelance shoutcaster. “Shoutcasters can explain what’s happening in an entertaining way.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            There are now 9.5 million e-Sports viewers in South East Asia (SEA) alone. The number is projected to grow to 40 million by 2019 according to the same Newzoo report.

                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            Shoutcasting may appear easy to some people, but professional shoutcasters like Sean said he could do a good job only if he’s understood the game thoroughly and prepared his delivery well.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “You have to keep pushing yourself to improve,” he added.
                                            <br></br>
                                            A shoutcaster also needs a shining, spontaneous personality to stand out.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “Some can work hard for long period of time, and never get recognized for their work,” said Chris “The Chris Man” Lim, an ex-caster for Garena.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Lyn-Feng also agreed. “It was a long grind,” he said. “It took me almost two years to gain recognition.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            But Lyn-Feng is not daunted by the need to work hard. He is also fine with losing sleep when casting American or European games overnight. Rather, he’s more concerned about his mother’s objection.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “She thought I was just trying to play games,” said Lyn-Feng, adding that his mother has been asking him to go to university and focus on his studies.
                                            <br></br>
                                            But he’s not ready to give in yet, especially as he’s still trying to make up for lost time after spending 2 years in National Service (NS).
                                            <br></br>
                                            “I was definitely frustrated,” said Lyn-Feng. “You lose job opportunities if you go missing for 2 years.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            While it might take some time before shoutcasting is broadly recognized as a “proper” profession here, shoutcasters like Sean and Lyn-Feng are not losing heart.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Sean, for instance, said he will continue working towards his dream. To cast an exciting Dota2 Major that is.

                                            Three Singaporeans fans share why they’re happy parting with their money to support K-pop boy bands like BTS, Highlight and Wanna One.

                                            Since Ms Sarah Lee, 27, started supporting Korean boy band BTS in 2015, she’s spent tens of thousands of dollars on merchandise, gifts, concert tickets and even “fan projects”.
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            She organizes fan projects via a Twitter account (@hopenight_SG) that she’s created and maintained for J-Hope, a member of BTS. For her latest project, she’s working on pooling donations from fans to buy birthday gifts for J-Hope. This will be her last birthday gift to J-Hope as BTS’ announced their decision to stop receiving gifts on 24 Jan.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “When we buy birthday ads, it’s to let our idols know that we’re celebrating their birthdays with them even though we can’t be together,” Ms Lee told The UrbanWire. “Buying gifts for them is also a way for us to pamper them and let them know that they’re appreciated and loved.”
                                            </p>

                                            Previously, Ms Lee has managed to raise some $6,000 in collaboration with @bulletproof_SG, a fan site for BTS. They spent the money on a video advertisement to promote their idols’ accomplishment. She said such practice is very common in South Korea.
                                            <br></br>
                                            In recent years, more K-Pop fans have upped the ante and took to advertising in Times Square, New York. A 15s per hour spot on both the NASDAQ and Thomson Reuters boards at the busy commercial intersection can cost around US$30,000 ($39,669) for a week, according to Forbes.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Ms Lee acknowledges that K-pop fans who spend beyond their means could break the bank, so she said she’d track her expenses carefully.

                                            “I bought 46 copies of the same album to get into Highlight’s fan signing event,” said the 18-year-old. “It was expensive but worth it as it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to meet my idols.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            Cindy was able to recoup part of her investment when she re-sold the albums.

                                            All three fans stressed that their love for their idols cannot and should not be measured by how much they’ve spent.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “It’s turned into a competition for some fans, seeing who can buy better gifts…I think it’s gone overboard,” Valerie said.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “Some idols have stopped receiving gifts because they don’t want their fans to spend so much money on them.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            She added that she hopes to see more fans donating to good causes in their idols’ names instead.

                                            “I think that’s more meaningful.”

                                            Young food stylist and photographer Winnie Lee (@dumplingmumplings) can help you with that.
                                            <br></br>
                                            The 19-year-old is known for her knack in turning the simplest of ingredients into a visual delight on Instagram. As a vegetarian, the Ngee Ann Polytechnic student found her food choices on campus rather limited. Hence, she often packs her own lunches and shares photos of her beautiful creations on Instagram.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Since she started posting regularly in 2016, she’s attracted more than 3,300 followers on Instagram. Her shots also courted the attention of food delivery firm Deliveroo and widely-followed food blogger @tumblinbumblincrumblincookie, which has since led to several collaborations.

                                            <b>What is aperture?</b>
                                            <br></br>
                                            Aperture refers to the lens diaphragm opening inside a photographic lens. The aperture stop of a photographic lens can be adjusted to control the amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <b>What is ISO?</b>
                                            <br></br>
                                            ISO measures the sensitivity of the image sensor. The higher the ISO, the more sensitive the camera is to light whereas a lower ISO decreases the camera’s light sensitivity. The ISO setting can also affect image quality. A higher ISO would result in grainier images and vice versa.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <b>What is shutter speed?</b>
                                            <br></br>
                                            The shutter speed is the length of time the camera sensor is exposed to light. A faster shutter speed can be used to capture moving objects. On the other hand, a slower shutter speed is ideal for capturing ‘motion blur’ images.

                                            The pastry chef in question is Hinna Belani, the 26-year-old founder of Diamond Chefs.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Ms Belani started her home-based business when she was just 17, alongside her older sister, specializing in baking vegan, eggless cakes.
                                            <br></br>
                                            With few competitors then, her cakes were an instant hit with many vegetarians in the Indian community. At times, she said she could receive up to 7 orders in a day, with many customers requesting for the labor-intensive 3-tier wedding cakes. Business was so brisk that her parents and elder sister had to help out.
                                            </p>

                                            Now, the young mother said she enjoys baking first-year birthday cakes the most, especially after she’s baked an elegantly gilded floral-themed strawberry cake for her daughter Aanya, who turned one last May.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “When parents ask me to make their child’s first birthday cake, I feel very proud that they have chosen me,” she said.

                                            Ms Belani has always been keenly aware of her artistic and creative flair. She has a double diploma in Culinary Arts and Pastry & Bakery from At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy. She’s also attended many patisserie courses in Singapore and Sydney to sharpen her skills.

                                            While she dreams of opening a bakery, she’s concerned about the steep rents, overheads and labor costs that accompany a brick-and-mortar business.
                                            <br></br>
                                            But for now, she’s happy working from home as she could spend more time with Aanya.

                                            For Reginald Morris, wearing makeup is his way of remembering his late sister.
                                        </p>
                                        <div class="project-article my-4">
                                            <img src="../Stories-Selector/img/OnlineJourn/Article6/1.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto mt-4"/>
                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            When Mr Reginald “Reggie” Morris was 5, he started paying attention to his mother’s beauty routine. When he’s older, he started applying makeup for his younger sister, Regine Monica.
                                            <br></br>
                                            By now, the 22-year-old is so adept at glamming up his face with bold colors and statement pieces that his Instagram posts (@glamorrisness) have courted the attention of makeup brands including NYX Cosmetics, Kat Von D and Velvet Vanity. Last year, he gamely took part in the NYX Fine Artistry of Cosmetic Elites (FACE) Awards. He’s the first and only male contestant in Singapore to join the female-oriented contest.
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            Growing up, Reggie knew that his affinity for makeup would raise a few eyebrows in school and at home. But he’s bent on improving his skills, never mind if some might label him a “vainpot”. So he’s grateful that his sister Monica was always ready to be his “human-sized Barbie doll”. Even when he’s unhappy with the look that he’s created for her, she’d proudly show it off to her friends. And when he’s completed his own makeup, she’s always there to cheer him on.

                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            The brother and sister bonded over their numerous private “makeover” sessions until September 2015. “The next session never happened,” Reggie said.
                                            <br></br>
                                            He recalled receiving a phone call from a police officer, informing him that Monica and her boyfriend had taken their own lives.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Reggie spent the next 4 days in his bedroom – speechless and sleepless. Shortly after, he was diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            It took weeks before Reggie decided to pick up a brush again. Then, he realized whenever he applied makeup, he could relive the “happy memories” with his sister. He would use her favorite Urban Decay Naked II palette, but would leave her favorite eyeshadow colour (‘Half Baked’) untouched.
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="mt-4">
                                            That gave Reggie an even stronger drive to continue experimenting with makeup. He also grew more comfortable in his own skin. Now, he’s often seen wearing a turban, rocking the stubble, with brightly painted lips and gorgeously dolled-up eyes.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “I might as well give them (other people) something to look at,” he said.

                                            The Nanyang Polytechnic graduate is now working towards being a makeup artist. He believes that his sister would encourage him to pursue his dream.

                                            “She’d be so proud of me,” he said.

                                            “Money is still the most important thing. Those who say money can’t buy happiness are wrong,” Ms Lee said.
                                            <br></br>
                                            A firm believer in self-reliance, she added that women should earn their own keep.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “Don’t marry the rich, be rich. Just earn (the money) yourself, don’t count on guys to pay for everything.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            Ms Lee first set foot in the Thai disco scene when she was 19. She was standing in for a performer for 3 nights, and after she learnt about the attractive salary, she decided to stay on as a full-timer.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Having to work the unenviable shift from 8pm to 3am isn’t an issue with her. To Ms Lee, the bigger challenge is having to stand firm against uncouth customers who asked to take the girls out.
                                            <br></br>
                                            As the flower girls’ agent, Ms Lee said she has to watch out for their safety.
                                            <br></br>
                                            She’s also had to fend off unwanted sexual advances.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Ms Lee said: “I don’t bother to politely reject these men. I say I’m not that kind of girl.”

                                            Despite some unpleasant episodes, Ms Lee still regards the club as her “second home”, after having forged solid friendships with her colleagues and customers.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Her parents are also supportive of her work despite the social stigma associated with it.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “I can’t be more proud of her,” said Ms Agnes Lim, Ms Lee’s mother. “Although it is not a career I would encourage her to pursue, she is happy, successful and earning more than I did when I was 25.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            For now, Ms Lee is happy in her job. But she has bigger dreams in mind. She hopes to study fashion and jewelry design in the near future, and opens her own Thai disco when she has enough capital to start one.

                                            Since 1998, 37-year-old Mohamed Khalid, also known as Khaal, has been on a mission to educate Singaporeans about the music that shaped him and his life.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Khaal is the owner of Ravage Records, Singapore’s only extreme metal store. Besides managing the quaint little shop in Golden Mile Tower, Khaal is also a member of Balberith, a Singaporean metal band.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Together with his bandmates and friends from Singapore’s metal community, Khaal formed Singahell Death Squad, a group determined to uphold the legacy of Singaporean metal legends like Impiety and Stukas. The group host live shows and give up-and-coming bands opportunities to perform.
                                            <br></br>
                                            With Ravage Records, Khaal hopes to interact with a new breed of metal fans, and show people that his brethren — the “metalheads” — are exactly like everyone else.
                                            <br></br>
                                            “We’re the next generation. It’s a shame if we don’t bring forward the metal tradition.”
                                            <br></br>
                                            A budding metalhead or just curious about Khaal? Step into his store.

It is now also capable of spreading faster and farther with more and more people relying on social media and search engines for news.

                                            Base make-up products may look the same, but do they work the same?

                                            While base make-up products such as foundation, BB and CC cream may be not new to the market, the introduction of yet another double-letter formulation, the DD cream, may be of a surprise to many.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Although seemingly similar to a foundation when applied on, each product is formulated to serve different skin types and provide varying benefits for the skin.
                                            <br></br>
                                            While BB cream stands for Beauty Balm and serves as a tinted moisturiser with an extra touch of coverage, CC Cream is used for “colour-correcting” and to tackle issues like redness and sallowness.
                                            <br></br>
                                            DD cream or otherwise called a “Dynamic Do-All” cream, is a rather new product which works like a hybrid of the BB and CC creams.

                                            Travel junkies Daniel Ng, 30, and Gina Cheong, 29, love going off the beaten path.

                                            The couple went on an epic trip in 2014, covering 12 countries including China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Turkey and Greece.

                                            That year-long trip cost them $10,000 – much less than what they would have spent if they had stayed in Singapore, Ms Cheong told The UrbanWire.

                                            The savvy duo, who’re co-running aww.media, a production company, have been sharing their travel hacks on Sunrise Odyssey since 2014. Besides using the blog to document their adventures, they also want to share how the acts of kindness they’ve experienced along the way have helped “restore [their] faith in humanity”.

                                            Singapore is home to close to 300,000 migrant construction workers last year, according to the Ministry of Manpower.

                                            Many workers paid an exorbitant agent fee to secure a job here. But when they lose the ability to work as a result of illness or injury, they lose their work permits too.

                                            The UrbanWire speaks to 4 such migrant workers, who are issued special passes to stay in Singapore legally as they wait for compensation. Their full names are left out in this story at their request.

                                            Mr Raja (above, left) and Mr Kumar (above, right) are both from India.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Mr Raja came to Singapore in 2012 to make more money to support his wife and 5-year-old son.

                                            One month into the job, the construction worker broke his left wrist (see below) after falling from a height and landing on his hands. Now, his left hand is too weak to carry even just a small bag of groceries.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Mr Raja knows he’s unlikely to find employment in a similar role in the future. But he hopes to be able to find a light duty work so he can continue making a living here.

                                            In September 2017, he was water-proofing a shop by the roadside when there was ongoing road repair work. At one point, he fell off the ladder, and his right hand unfortunately landed in hot tar, resulting in third-degree burns (see below). Now that he can’t use his dominant hand for even basic tasks like eating and writing, he has to learn using his left hand.
                                            <br></br>
                                            Mr Kumar said he calls his family every day. He misses home, but also wishes to stay in Singapore. Providing for his family remains his top priority.
